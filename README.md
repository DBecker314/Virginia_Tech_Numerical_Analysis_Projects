# Matlabs

This repository is a collection of several numerical analysis matlab projects I completed in college.

### Polygon Area Project

The goal of this project was to design a matlab function that could compute the area of a convex region with a curved boundary with greater accuracy then the predefined matlab function polyarea.  After some testing and development, I was able to create a function between one and two orders of accuracy higher than matlab under the condition that the region was convex.

### Spline Interpolation Project

The goal of this project was to test the accuracy of four different spline interpolation methods.  Using the provided function myspline along with my own code, I was able to show the difference in accuracy between each of the four methods and why each method performed as it did.

### Zero Convergence Project

The goal of this project was to design a program that could find the roots of a function using the Newton-Raphson method.  Using this method, I was able to write a script that could approximate a function root within a trillionth of the true solution that would otherwise be unsolvable for a computer.

### Matrix Convergence Project

The goal of this project was to write a series of functions to test different iterative methods for solving matrices.  Solving matrices using iterative methods uses a fraction of the time and computational cost of standard methods and produces very accurate approximations.

### Gaussian Elimination Project

The goal of this project was to write a function that could perform Gaussian elimination with pivoting to solve a given matrix.  This is a standard method for solving matrices by hand; however, it gets very computationally expensive for large matrices, so there is very little real-world application of this method.
